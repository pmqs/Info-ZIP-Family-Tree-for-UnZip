UnZip 6.10a

We have posted UnZip Beta 6.10a, August 23rd 2010.  This is a beta
release and considerable additional work is planned before UnZip 6.10 is
released.  See the file History.610 for development details of what's in
this beta.

As always, send in your feature suggestions and bug reports as they may
influence development of UnZip 6.10.

Quick list of major changes in UnZip 6.10a:

- Ported new Zip command parser that supports long options, such as
  --license.
- As result of new parser, option negation now uses trailing "-" instead
  of leading "-".  So -B turns on the new UNIX backup option and -B-
  turns it off.  Negation also works on long options, such as --backup-
  to turn the backup option off.  Also, multiple levels of negation
  (such as ----q in UnZip 6.00) are currently no longer supported.
- New option --options lists all available options.
- New option --commandline shows the input command line as processed,
  and exits.
- New --license option lists the license.  This allows distribution of
  UnZip 6.10 without additional documentation.
- Minor updates to zipgrep.
- Preliminary support for AppleDouble storage of resource information on
  Macintosh (Mac OS X).
- Added new "VMS symlinks are working" check.
- Additional system information reported using -v option.
- Additional control of UID/GID and SGID restore.
- VMS verbose report and update of VMS notes.
- VMS return code updates.
- File name checks now use wide character checks to find non-printing
  characters to display as '?'.  This should fix a bug where '?' was
  being displayed for parts of multi-byte characters.
- File INSTALL with installation procedures updated.
- Add ZipInfo -C option.
- Replace VMS /[NO]CASE_INSENSITIVE with /CASE_MATCH.
- Fix compile problems when using ZLIB with funzip.
- Fix problems using SFX and ZLIB or BZIP2.

As always, see the UnZip manual page, the extended help in UnZip
("unzip -hh"), and any relevant OS-specific documentation for details on
what UnZip has and how to use all features.

Enjoy!
