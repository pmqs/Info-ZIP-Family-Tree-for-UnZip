UnZip, version 6.0b BETA, 12 November 2004

Features added (or removed):

6.0a ():
 - many changes by Myles

6.0b (12 Nov 04):
 - added dll changes from Mike White [EG]
 - added Unix Large File Support but must be enabled manually [EG]
 - humble beginnings of adding configure script to Unix port to
    autoconfigure large file support [EG]
 - VMS changes, including large file support, better handling of
   -V and new -VV options, revised build procedures, and
   documentation updates [SMS]
 - file_size added to process.c to handle files sizes larger
   than 2 GB more cleanly when no large file support [SMS]
 - large file debugging on Unix and VMS [SMS, EG]
 - added ATHEOS port [Ruslan Nickolaev, EG]
 - split w32i64.h with large file includes for dll [EG]

6.0c (xx Nov 04):

 - Faster VMS I/O, both reading the archive and creating extracted
   data files.  Disk paralysis during file allocation, when
   highwater marking is enabled on the destination device, is gone.


Bugs fixed:

6.0b (12 Nov 04):

 - output bug fixes to account for sizes > 2 Gb and < 4 GB [EG]

 - bug fixes in ZipInfo [EG]

 - reverted unix.c to an older version to make
   calls to defer_dir_attribs compatible.  Also needed to rework
   win32.c to make compatible.  Probably broke NT but haven't tested.
   Need to trace out and fix [EG]


6.0c (xx Nov 04):

 - On VMS, "cannot find either fred;1 or fred;1.zip." messages changed
   to show only non-fictional file names.
