UnZip, version 6.00c BETA, 14 January 2005

Features added (or removed):

6.00a ():
 - Many changes by Myles

6.00b (12 Nov 04):
 - Added dll changes from Mike White.  [MW, EG]
 - Added Unix Large File Support but must be enabled manually.  [EG]
 - Humble beginnings of adding configure script to Unix port to
    autoconfigure large file support.  [EG]
 - VMS changes, including large file support, better handling of
   -V and new -VV options, revised build procedures, and
   documentation updates.  [SMS]
 - file_size added to process.c to handle files sizes larger
   than 2 GB more cleanly when no large file support.  [SMS]
 - Large file debugging on Unix and VMS.  [SMS, EG]
 - Added ATHEOS port [Ruslan Nickolaev, EG]
 - Split w32i64.h with large file includes for dll [EG]

6.00c (17 Jan 05):

 - Faster VMS I/O, both reading the archive and creating extracted
   data files.  Disk paralysis during file allocation, when
   highwater marking is enabled on the destination device, is
   gone.  [SMS]
 - Various Amiga and Win32 changes (see files).  [PK]
 - Add NOSHARE compile option for VMS.  [SMS]


Bugs fixed:

6.00b (12 Nov 04):

 - Output bug fixes to account for sizes > 2 Gb and < 4 GB.  [EG]
 - Bug fixes in ZipInfo.  [EG]
 - Reverted unix.c to an older version to make
   calls to defer_dir_attribs compatible.  Also needed to rework
   win32.c to make compatible.  Probably broke NT but haven't tested.
   Need to trace out and fix.  [EG]
 - On VMS, when an odd output byte count is incremented to the next
   larger even value, the extra byte written is now always zero,
   reducing random differences between original and extracted files.  [SMS]


6.00c (17 Jan 05):

 - On VMS, "cannot find either fred;1 or fred;1.zip." messages changed
   to show only non-fictional file names.  [SMS]
 - Debian patch 001 - change __GNU__ to __GLIBC__ in unix/unxcfg.h.  This is
   required to build under glibc-based systems not being Linux-based (like
   the Debian GNU/kFreeBSD port, which is in preparation).  In fact,
   everywhere the macro __GNU__ is used, __GLIBC__ should be used instead.
   It could be made even shorter since defined(linux) || defined(__GLIBC__)
   should be the same as simply defined(__GLIBC__).  [?, EG]
 - Debian patch 002 - add newline to end of cannot open zipfile message
   in fileio.c.  [?, EG]
 - Various bug fixes (see files gbloffs.c, process.c, unzpriv.h, amiga/amiga.h,
   amiga/filedate.c, amiga/flate.a, amiga/makefile.azt, and win32/w32cfg.h).  [PK]
 - Some type changes in globals.h.  [SMS]
