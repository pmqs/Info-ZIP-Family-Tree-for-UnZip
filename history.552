UnZip, version 5.52, 30 Dec 2004

Features added (or removed):

5.52a (10 Dec 04):
 - no new features.

5.52b (30 Dec 04):
 - a note added to README file.

5.52c (8 Jan 05):
 - no new features.

5.52d (17 Jan 05):
 - Faster VMS I/O, both reading the archive and creating extracted data
   files.  Disk paralysis during file allocation, when highwater marking
   is enabled on the destination device, is gone.
 - Where the C RTL permits, with SET PROCESS /PARSE = EXTENDED,
   command-line case is preserved, obviating quotation of upper- or
   mixed-case options and parameters.


Bugs fixed:

5.52a (10 Dec 04):
 - Debian patch 001 - change __GNU__ to __GLIBC__ in unix/unxcfg.h.  This is
   required to build under glibc-based systems not being Linux-based (like
   the Debian GNU/kFreeBSD port, which is in preparation).  In fact,
   everywhere the macro __GNU__ is used, __GLIBC__ should be used instead.
   It could be made even shorter since defined(linux) || defined(__GLIBC__)
   should be the same as simply defined(__GLIBC__).
 - Debian patch 002 - add newline to end of cannot open zipfile message
   in fileio.c.

5.52b (30 Dec 04):
 - format fixes.

5.52c (8 Jan 05):
 - minor fixes.

5.52d (17 Jan 05):
 - On VMS, when an odd output byte count is incremented to the next
   larger even value, the extra byte written is now always zero,
   reducing random differences between original and extracted files.
 - On VMS, "cannot find either fred;1 or fred;1.zip." messages have been
   changed to show only non-fictional file names.


==================

These changes occurred in beta versions 5.52a to 5.52b.  This list may have

mileage may vary, etc., etc.
