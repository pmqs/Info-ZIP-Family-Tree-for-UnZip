UnZip, version 6.10, -- ----- 2010

Features added (or removed):

6.10a00 (5 Jul 2010):
 - Copy over UnZip 6.00 and rename as UnZip 6.10a00.  [EG]

6.10a01 (5 Jul 2010):
 - No feature changes.

6.10a02 (10 Jul 2010):
 - Add new command parser code from new-cmdparser/unz6-newcmdparser-diffs.txt,
    which is a modified version of the new Zip parser.  Some modifications to
    account for changes in UnZip since code was written.  UnZip now supports
    use of get_option() to parse the command line, adding support for a
    command table and long options.  Command parsing now mostly similar to
    that used in Zip, but most of UnZip syntax preserved.  One big difference
    is inverting an option (making negative) is now done by a trailing "-"
    instead of a leading one.  See the long help and the manual for the
    current syntax of these and all commands.  (unzip.c, unzpriv.h, zipinfo.c,
    vms/cmdline.c) [EG]
 - Changed zipgrep to cope with the new command parser.  Added environment
    variable ZIPGREP_UNZIP to let the user specify a particular UnZip program
    to use.  (unix/zipgrep) [SMS]
 - Add new option --license to show the license and note added to short help
    displayed when no command arguments that this new option exists.  Allows
    distribution of UnZip under the current Info-ZIP license without additional
    documentation.  Calls show_license().  (unzip.c) [EG]
 - Add preliminary support for AppleDouble storage of resource information on
    Mac platforms.  (extract.c, fileio.c, globals.h, unzip.c, unzip.h,
    unzpriv.h, unix/unix.c) [SMS]
 - Add VMS symlink works check.  (extract.c) [SMS]
 - Add new option --options to show all available options.  (unzip.c) [EG]
 - Add strerror() if port does not have one.  Add check for mbstr.h.
    (unzpriv.h, unix/configure, unix/unix.c) [SMS]
 - Add uname calls to get system identification.  (unix/configure, unix/unix.c)
    [SMS]
 - Add control of UID/GID and SGID using X_flag and K_flag.  (unix/unix.c,
    vms/vms.c) [SMS]
 - Add verbose report.  (vms/cmdline.c, vms/unz_cli.cld) [SMS]
 - Update VMS notes.  (vms/notes.txt) [SMS]
 - VMS return code updates and allow restoring old status codes.  (vms/vms.c)
    [SMS]

6.00a03 (30 Jul 2010):
 - fnfilter() now converts to a wide character string and does the isprint()
    check on that, avoiding the issue of doing the check on multi-byte
    characters.  (extract.c, win32/win32.c, unzpriv.h, process.c) [EG]
 - Update TODO list.  (ToDo) [EG]

6.00a04 (5 Aug 2010):
 - Updated INSTALL with latest information. [SMS]
 - Remove 8-bit ASCII characters from ToDo. Add items. [SMS]
 - Add ZipInfo "C" option to command table.  (unzip.c) [SMS]
 - Add new option --commandline to show the processed command line and exit.
    Add new function show_commandline(). Update extended help.  (unzip.c,
    fileio.c, unzip.h, zipinfo.c) [EG]

6.00a05 (8 Aug 2010):
 - No feature changes.

6.00a06 (9 Aug 2010):

6.00a03 (30 Jul 2010):
 - Fixed compile problems involving funzip and use of zlib.  (inflate.c) [SMS]
 - Changed SFX to allow --license, but not --options.  Removed some redundant
    "BETA" messages, and an unreachable "return".  (unzip.c) [SMS]
 - Fixed various builder problems involving the use of zlib, or when defining
    BZIP2_SFX to get bzip2 compression support in UnZipSFX.  (unix/configure,
    unix/Makefile) [SMS]

    unchanged.  (acorn/acorn.c, amiga/amiga.c, aosvs/aosvs.c, atari/atari.c,
    atheos/atheos.c, beos/beos.c, flexos/flexos.c, human68k/human68k.c,
    macos/source/macos.c, msdos/msdos.c, netware/netware.c, os2/os2.c,
    qdos/qdos.c, tandem/tanunz.c, unix/unix.c, vms/vms.c, win32/win32.c) [SMS]
 - Changed argc+1 to argc to work with new parser.  Removed CMS_MVS 'U' option.
    Changed u0.L_flag-negative to u0.L_flag-1 as negative is now always 0 or 1.
    (unzip.c) [EG]

6.00a04 (5 Aug 2010):
 - Set minimum value of u0.X_flag to -1 instead of 0, allowing flag to take on

 - Change vms_unzip_cmdline() from ulg to unsigned.  (unzpriv.h) [SMS]
 - Add newlines to command parser error messages.  (unzip.c) [EG]

6.00a05 (8 Aug 2010):
 - Change fnfilter() from using code used for Unicode for wide char conversions
    to using standard ANSI wide calls, avoiding dependencies on zwstring and so
    the need to restructure that code so it works in all contexts.  (extract.c)
    [EG]

6.00a06 (9 Aug 2010):
 - Add (char *) casts in fnfilter().  Add (ulg) cast in utf8_to_ucs4_string().
