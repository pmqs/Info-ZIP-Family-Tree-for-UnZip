UnZip 6.10c

Announcement for UnZip Beta 6.10c, >>25 Feb 2014.  This is a beta
release.  Changes may be made before UnZip 6.10 is released.  See the
file History.610 for development details of changes in this beta
release.

Complaints and suggestions regarding this beta release can help to
improve the next full release.

Quick list of major changes in UnZip 6.10c (See INSTALL and README for
details):

- New command-line parser (like that in Zip 3.0) allows long ("--xxx")
  and two-character short ("-yy") options.  Options are now negated by a
  trailing hyphen.  See extended help and manual for details.
- Optional support for WinZip-compatible AES encryption (compression
  method 99).
- Optional support for LZMA (method 14) and PPMd (method 98)
  compression.
- Behavior change: Now, by default, date-time information is restored on
  extracted files only, not on created directories.  See option
  -D/--dir-timestamps.
- Behavior change: Now, by default, permission/protection information is
  restored on Unix(-like) and VMS systems, but limited by the user's
  Unix umask or VMS default protection.  See option
  -k/--keep-permissions, below.
- Behavior change: ZipInfo report format changes (minor).
- Behavior change: Now, on Unix(-like) and VMS systems,
  -X/--restore-owner (/RESTORE = OWNER) controls only restoration of
  Unix UID/GID or VMS UIC.
- Behavior change: Apparent VMS version numbers (";ddd", where "ddd" is
  a decimal number) are now stripped by default only on files which were
  archived on a VMS system.  A Unix file named, for example, "fred;123"
  will now, by default, be extracted on a non-VMS system as "fred;123",
  not "fred".
- New -da/--auto-extract-dir option specifies extraction into a
  subdirectory whose name is derived from the base name of the archive. 
  So, for example, "unzip -da fred.zip" would extract files into
  subdirectory "fred" ("[.fred]" on VMS).  This avoids cluttering the
  current directory with files if the archive structure lacks a
  top-level directory.
- Extended -j/--junk-dirs option accepts an optional value, the number
  of directory levels to discard.
- New --jar option may help with poorly formed Java "jar" archives.
- New -k/--keep-permissions option controls how permissions are restored
  on Unix and VMS systems.  The default behavior has changed to apply
  Unix umask or VMS default protection to the archive permissions.  With
  -k, the archive permissions are restored, ignoring the Unix umask or
  VMS default protection (the old default behavior).  With -k-, the
  archive permissions are ignored, and the Unix umask or VMS default
  protection determines the permissions.
- New -ka/--keep-acl option controls ACL restoration on VMS.  Now
  -X/--restore-owner controls restoration of only ownership (UIC),
  independent of ACLs.
- New --license option shows the software license.
- -s/--space-to-uscore should now work on most system types.
- Revised documentation ("man", VMS help, ...).
- fUnZip should support Zip64 (large-file) format extensions, and it
  should skip directories at the beginning of an archive, instead of
  doing nothing when the first archive member is not a file.
- zipgrep should accept (up to four) long-form options (--option) to
  help GNU grep users.
- Optional support on Unix and VMS for an UnZip object library,
  providing a callable UnZip interface for a user-written program.
- New user-triggered progress messages on Unix (SIGUSR1) and VMS
  (Ctrl/T).
- New C macro ICONV_MAPPING replaces the recently added
  USE_ICONV_MAPPING.
- Revised Unix builders now use "CC=gcc" with target "generic", instead
  of old target "generic_gcc".
- Support for AppleDouble storage of attribute/resource information on
  Mac OS X systems, with options to control restoration of extended
  attributes.
- VMS CLI changes: New /CASE_MATCH is gone.  Old /[NO]CASE_INSENSITIVE
  is back, but deprecated, replaced by /MATCH=CASE={BLIND|SENSITIVE}.
  When built with WILD_STOP_AT_DIR defined, /MATCH=[NO]WILD_MATCH_SLASH
  (-W) controls how wildcards match "/" separators in archive member
  names.  /JUNK_DIRS (-j) now accepts an optional value, the number of
  directory levels to discard.  New /LICENSE (--license) option.  New
  /NAMES=[NO]DOWNCASE replaces old, deprecated /[NO]LOWERCASE and
  /[NO]UPPERCASE.  New /NAMES=ODS2 replaces old, deprecated /ODS2.  New
  /NAMES=[NO]SPACES (-s) controls conversion of " " to "_" on ODS5
  destination.  New /EXISTING={NEW_VERSION|OVERWRITE|NOEXTRACT} option
  replaces old, deprecated /[NO]OVERWRITE.  New /[NO]DECIMAL_TIME
  replaces old, deprecated /[NO]TIMES.  New /RESTORE = ACL
  (-ka/--keep-acl) option controls whether ACLs are restored.  New
  /RESTORE = OWNER (-X/--restore-owner) option controls whether UICs are
  restored.  New /RESTORE = [NO]PROTECTION = {LIMITED|ORIGINAL}
  (-k/--keep-permissions) option controls whether/how permissions are
  restored.  With LIMITED (the default), the default protection is
  applied to the archive permissions.  With ORIGINAL, the default
  protection is ignored, and the archive permissions are used.  (This is
  the old default behavior.)  With NOPROTECTION, archive permissions are
  ignored, and the default protection is used.  New
  /[NO]AUTO_DIRECTORY[=REUSE] (-da/--auto-extract-dir) option controls
  automatic extraction destination subdirectory.
- New builders for Microsoft Visual Studio (Visual C++) 2010 have more
  options, fewer projects.  (Service Pack 1 may be needed for VS 2010. 
  VS 2012 (and newer?) should be compatible.)
- Windows DLL now offers a command-line (argc, argv[]) interface which
  should be more stable than the old binary structure interface.  See
  example code in unzipstb.c.

As always, see the UnZip manual page, the extended help in UnZip
("unzip -hh"), and any relevant OS-specific documentation for details on
UnZip features, limitations, and usage.
