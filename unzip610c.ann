UnZip 6.10c

Announcement for UnZip Beta 6.10c, >>23 May 2013.  This is a beta
release.  Changes may be made before UnZip 6.10 is released.  See the
file History.610 for development details of changes in this beta
release.

Complaints and suggestions regarding this beta release can help to
improve the next full release.

Quick list of major changes in UnZip 6.10c:

- Optional support for AES encryption compatible with WinZip version
  (compression method 99).  See INSTALL.
- Optional support for LZMA and PPMd compression.  See INSTALL.
- Extended -j/--junk-dirs option accepts an optional value, the number
  of directory levels to discard.
- New --jar option may help with poorly formed Java "jar" archives.
- New -k/--keep-permissions option controls how permissions are restored
  on Unix and VMS systems.  The default behavior has changed, to apply
  Unix umask or VMS default protection to the archive permissions.  With
  -k, the archive permissions are restored, ignoring the Unix umask or
  VMS default protection (the old default behavior).  With -k-, the
  archive permissions are ignored, and the Unix umask or VMS default
  protection determines the permissions.
- New -ka/--keep-acl option controls ACL restoration on VMS.  Now
  -X/--restore-owner controls restoration of only ownership (UIC),
  independent of ACLs.
- -s/--space-to-uscore should now work on most system types.
- Revised documentation ("man", VMS help, ...).
- fUnZip should support Zip64 (large-file) format extensions, and it
  should skip directories at the beginning of an archive, instead of
  doing nothing when the first archive member is not a file.
- zipgrep should accept (up to four) long-form options (--option) to
  help GNU grep users.
- Optional support on Unix and VMS for an UnZip object library,
  providing a callable UnZip interface for a user-written program.
- New macro ICONV_MAPPING replaces the recently added macro
  USE_ICONV_MAPPING.
- Revised Unix builders now use "CC=gcc" with target "generic", instead
  of old target "generic_gcc".  See INSTALL for details on this and
  other changes and options.
- VMS CLI changes: New /CASE_MATCH is gone.  Old /[NO]CASE_INSENSITIVE
  is back, but deprecated, replaced by /MATCH=CASE={BLIND|SENSITIVE}.
  When built with WILD_STOP_AT_DIR defined, /MATCH=[NO]WILD_MATCH_SLASH
  (-W) controls how wildcards match "/" separators in archive member
  names.  /JUNK_DIRS now accepts an optional value, the number of
  directory levels to discard.  New /LICENSE (--license) option.  New
  /NAMES=[NO]DOWNCASE replaces old, deprecated /[NO]LOWERCASE and
  /[NO]UPPERCASE.  New /NAMES=ODS2 replaces old, deprecated /ODS2.  New
  /NAMES=[NO]SPACES (-s) controls conversion of " " to "_" on ODS5
  destination.  New /EXISTING={NEW_VERSION|OVERWRITE|NOEXTRACT} option
  replaces old, deprecated /[NO]OVERWRITE.  New /[NO]DECIMAL_TIME
  replaces old, deprecated /[NO]TIMES.  New /RESTORE = ACL
  (-ka/--keep-acl) option controls whether ACLs are restored.  New
  /RESTORE = OWNER (-X/--restore-owner) option controls whether UICs are
  restored.  New /RESTORE = [NO]PROTECTION = {LIMITED|ORIGINAL}
  (-k/--keep-permissions) option controls whether/how permissions are
  restored.  With LIMITED (the default), the default protection is
  applied to the archive permissions.  With ORIGINAL, the default
  protection is ignored, and the archive permissions are used.  (This is
  the old default behavior.)  With NOPROTECTION, archive permissions are
  ignored, and the default protection is used.

As always, see the UnZip manual page, the extended help in UnZip
("unzip -hh"), and any relevant OS-specific documentation for details on
UnZip features, limitations, and usage.
