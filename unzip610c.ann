UnZip 6.10c

Announcement for UnZip Beta 6.10c, >>25 January 2013.  This is a beta
release and considerable additional work is planned before UnZip 6.10 is
released.  See the file History.610 for development details of what's in
this beta.

As always, send in your feature suggestions and bug reports as they may
influence development of UnZip 6.10.

Quick list of major changes in UnZip 6.10c:

- Optional support for AES encryption compatible with WinZip version
  (compression method 99).  See INSTALL.
- Optional support for LZMA and PPMd compression.  See INSTALL.
- Extended -j/--junk-dirs option accepts an optional value, the number
  of directory levels to discard.
- New --jar option may help with poorly formed Java "jar" archives.
- -s/--space-to-uscore should now work on most system types.
- Revised documentation ("man", VMS help, ...).
- fUnZip should support Zip64 (large-file) format extensions, and it
  should skip directories at the beginning of an archive, instead of
  doing nothing when the first archive member is not a file.
- zipgrep should accept (up to four) long-form options (--option) to
  help GNU grep users.
- Optional support on Unix and VMS for an UnZip object library,
  providing a callable UnZip interface for a user-written program.
- New USE_ICONV_MAPPING macro is now ICONV_MAPPING.
- Revised Unix builders now use "CC=gcc" with target "generic", instead
  of old target "generic_gcc".  See INSTALL for details on this and
  other changes and options.
- VMS CLI changes: New /CASE_MATCH is gone.  Old /[NO]CASE_INSENSITIVE
  is back, but deprecated, replaced by /MATCH=CASE={BLIND|SENSITIVE}.
  When built with WILD_STOP_AT_DIR defined, /MATCH=[NO]WILD_MATCH_SLASH
  (-W) controls how wildcards match "/" separators in archive member
  names.  /JUNK_DIRS now accepts an optional value, the number of
  directory levels to discard.  New /LICENSE (--license) option.  New
  /NAMES=[NO]DOWNCASE replaces old, deprecated /[NO]LOWERCASE and
  /[NO]UPPERCASE.  New /NAMES=ODS2 replaces old, deprecated /ODS2.  New
  /NAMES=[NO]SPACES (-s) controls conversion of " " to "_" on ODS5
  destination.  New /EXISTING={NEW_VERSION|OVERWRITE|NOEXTRACT} option
  replaces old, deprecated /[NO]OVERWRITE.  New /[NO]DECIMAL_TIME
  replaces old, deprecated /[NO]TIMES.

As always, see the UnZip manual page, the extended help in UnZip
("unzip -hh"), and any relevant OS-specific documentation for details on
what UnZip has and how to use all features.

Enjoy!
