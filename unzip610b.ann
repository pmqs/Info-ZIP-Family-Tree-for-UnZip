UnZip 6.10b

Announcement for UnZip Beta 6.10b, December 10th 2010.  This is a beta
release and considerable additional work is planned before UnZip 6.10 is
released.  See the file History.610 for development details of what's in
this beta.

As always, send in your feature suggestions and bug reports as they may
influence development of UnZip 6.10.

Quick list of major changes in UnZip 6.10b:

- Implement Windows full Unicode support.  This support should be
  automatic now on NT and later platforms.
- Add -I and -O options for setting ISO and OEM character sets,
  respectively, used by UnZip when doing character set translations. 
  This support is based on the unzip60-alt-iconv-utf8 patch suggested in
  an Info-ZIP forum thread and uses the iconv library which must be
  available.  These options are enabled using the USE_ICONV_MAPPING
  compiler define.  Suggestions welcome on how to improve this limited
  character translation support.
- Various cleanup of VMS and Unicode code.
- Better handling of the PKWare verification bit.
- Fix bug in DLL code that prevented compiling.
- Minor updates to the VB6 example code showing use of the DLL.
- Implement Acorn port changes based on patch provided by J.L. that
  updates the port to use current compilers, increases allowed file path
  lengths to 1024 characters, adds directory attributes support, and
  updates documentation.

As always, see the UnZip manual page, the extended help in UnZip
("unzip -hh"), and any relevant OS-specific documentation for details on
what UnZip has and how to use all features.

Enjoy!
