Notes:

Compilation under GCC
---------------------

It is recommended that you use GCC 4 or higher and the corresponding 'make'
utility.  Both are available from <URL:http://www.riscos.info/index.php/GCCSDK>.

Use the "RunMe1st" file (it is an Obey file) to convert all the files from
"filename/[chs]" to "[chs].filename" (so that unzip could be easily compiled
under RISC OS).  It will also set the correct makefile.

To compile just set the CSD to the main unzip directory and run 'make'.

Compilation under Acorn C/C++
-----------------------------

Currently only the Acorn C V5 compiler has been tested but probably also
Acorn C V4 and the Acorn Assembler V2 will be able to compile unzip.

First check RunMe1st for a few lines that need uncommenting, in order to install
the Acorn C/C++ makefile as opposed to the GCC one.  Then run RunMe1st as normal
(i.e. set type to 'Obey' and then double-click).  The source tree should then be
renamed and the makefile installed in the right place.

To compile just set the CSD to the main unzip directory and run 'amu'.

Cross-compilation under GCCSDK
------------------------------

Use of RunMe1st is not required when using GCCSDK 4
(<URL:http://www.riscos.info/index.php/GCCSDK>).  Instead copy the GCC makefile
to the right place (e.g. 'cp acorn/GMakefile makefile') and then start the cross
compiler:

  $ /home/riscos/env/ro-make E=,ff8 CC=arm-unknown-riscos-gcc
